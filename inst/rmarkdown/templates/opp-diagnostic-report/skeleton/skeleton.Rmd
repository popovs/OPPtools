# Data Summary

Between `r min(year(dat$timestamp))` and `r max(year(dat$timestamp))`, `r length(unique(dat$individual_id))` individual `r params$spp`s at the `r unique(dat$study_site)` colony were tagged and tracked with `r as.character(unique(dat$sensor_type))` tags.

These `r length(unique(dat$individual_id))` individuals generated `r nrow(dat)` detections between `r as.Date(min(dat$timestamp))` and `r as.Date(max(dat$timestamp))`.

Raw tracking data are stored on Movebank (https://www.movebank.org/) in project number `r as.character(params$movebank_id)`. All analysis were conducted with R (version 4.1.0, R Core Team 2021). Code used to generate this report is available at https://github.com/popovs/OPPtools.

# Classifying foraging trips

Foraging trips were identified as any continuous track at least `r params$minDist` km from the colony, which lasted for a minimum of `r params$minDur` hours. Trips were considered incomplete if the trips started or ended more than `r params$maxDist` km from the colony. Trips were considered 'gappy' if there were gaps between successive locations greater than `r params$gapTime` hours, and the bird traveled farther than `r params$gapDist` km during that time. 

Table 1 summarizes trip attributes for each type of trip. Appendix A includes plots showing the trip classification from each individual deployment. `r if (length(grep('storm-petrel', params$spp)) == 1) "Because of the low GPS sampling rate and long commuting distances of storm-petrels, some consecutive trips are potentially combined here. These merged trips were retained in order to include time spent close to the colony in estimated utilization distributions. For this reason, trip summary statistics in Tables 1 and 2 should be interpreted with caution."`

```{r get trips}
trips <- opp_get_trips(dat2,
              innerBuff = params$minDist,
              returnBuff = params$maxDist,

# Track interpolation

Locations collected during complete, incomplete, and gappy trips were interpolated at a `r params$timestep` interval using a continuous time correlated random walk model. Gaps in tracks during a trip, as defined above, were `r ifelse(params$interpolateGaps == F, 'not','')` interpolated. Figure 2 shows maps comparing the raw and interpolated locations within trips for all deployments. Table 2 provides a summary of the number of raw and interpolated locations, trip duration, maximum trip distance and trip type for each identified foraging trip. Plots comparing the raw and interpolated data for each individual deployment are provided in Appendix B.

```{r interpolation}
interp <- ctcrw_interpolation(trips,
                    site = dat2$site,

# Kernel density estimates

```{r get smoothers}
h <- opp_href(interp$interp)
s <- opp_step(interp$interp)
s <- ifelse(s < 1, 1, s)
```

Given the sensitivity of kernel density estimates to the kernel smoother, it is important to choose the appropriate kernel smoother for a given species. Appendix C includes plots comparing kernel smoothers for each individual track parameters. These plots should be examined to identify any potential biases associated with using a particular smoother.

We considered three smoothers using a traditional kernel density estimate. The 'href' smoother is a data-driven method which is calculated from the variance in the X and Y directions in the data, in this case the median href was `r signif(h, 2)` km. Initial data exploration indicated that the href parameter could over smooth tracks, so that in complex tracks areas of high use were missed in the kernel density estimate, therefore we also considered the href/2, which was `r signif(h/2, 2)` km. Finally, we used a step smoother based on the median step length between interpolated locations across all tracks. `r if(s == 1){"The step function resulted in a value of less than 1 km; therefore, 'step' kernel density estimates were calculated with a smoother value of 1 km."} else {paste("The step smoother was", signif(s, 2), "km.")}`

`r if (params$includeBB == T) {"In addition to the traditional kernel density estimates, we considered a Brownian kernel estimate. This method uses two smoothers: sig1 is  based on the speed of the animal and was calculated independently for each track and sig2 is based on the logger accuracy (20 m)."}`

# Appendix A - Trip plots

Figures in this appendix show the trip classifications for each individual deployment. Locations are plotted as distance from colony over time, with points coloured according to trip type. Complete trips start and end close to the colony, and do not contain any large gaps in GPS locations. Incomplete trips do not contain any large gaps in GPS locations during the trips, but either start or end far away from the colony. 


```{r plot trip-types, fig.height=3.5}
trip_plots <- plot_trip_dist(data = trips, plotsPerPage = 1,

```

\newpage
# Appendix B - Interpolation plots

Figures in this appendix show the interpolated GPS locations relative to raw GPS locations for each individual deployment. Locations are plotted as distance from colony over time. Gaps in the interploted (teal) tracks, where no dashed line is plotted were times when the bird was not classified as in a foraging trip. Times where the interpolated track is shown with a dashed line, but no points were large gaps in GPS tracking during a foraging trip where no interpolation was performed.

```{r plot trip-interpolation, fig.height=3.5}
interp_plots <- plot_interp_dist(data = interp, 
                                 plotsPerPage = 1,
