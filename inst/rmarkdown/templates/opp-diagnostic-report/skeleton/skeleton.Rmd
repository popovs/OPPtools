# Summary

Between `r min(year(dat$timestamp))` and `r max(year(dat$timestamp))`, `r length(unique(dat$individual_id))` individual `r params$spp`s at the `r unique(dat$study_site)` colony were tagged and tracked with `r as.character(unique(dat$sensor_type))` tags.

These `r length(unique(dat$individual_id))` individuals generated `r nrow(dat)` detections between `r min(dat$timestamp)` UTC and `r max(dat$timestamp)` UTC.

Data are stored on Movebank in project number `r as.character(params$movebank_id)`.

```{r map, fig.cap = "Map of raw GPS locations."}
opp_map(dat)
```

# Trips

## Defining foraging trips

Foraging trips were identified as any continuous track at least `r params$minDist` km from the colony, which lasted for a minimum of `r params$minDur` hours. Trips were considered incomplete if the trips started or ended more than `r params$maxDist` km from the colony. Trips were considered 'gappy' if there were gaps between successive locations greater than `r params$gapTime` hours, and the bird traveled farther than `r params$gapDist` km during that time. 

The figures below show trips from each deployment, as defined by the criteria described above.

```{r get trips}
dat2 <- opp2KBA(dat)
trips <- opp_get_trips(dat2,
              innerBuff = params$minDist,
              returnBuff = params$maxDist,
              duration = params$minDur,
              gapTime = params$gapTime,
              gapDist = params$gapDist,
              gapLimit = params$gapLimit)
```

## Trip summary

```{r trip summary}
ft <- trips@data %>%
  filter(Type != 'Non-trip') %>% 
  group_by(ID, tripID, Type) %>% 
  mutate(
    duration = as.numeric(difftime(max(DateTime), min(DateTime), units = 'hours'))
  ) %>% 
  group_by(Type) %>%
  summarize(
    `Number of trips` = length(unique(tripID)),
    `Number of locations` = n(),
    `Median duration (hrs)` = round(median(duration), 1),
    `Median trip distance (km)` = round(median(max(ColDist))/1000, 1)
    ) %>% 
  flextable::flextable(cwidth =1.25)

print(ft)
