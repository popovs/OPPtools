# Summary

Between `r min(year(dat$timestamp))` and `r max(year(dat$timestamp))`, `r length(unique(dat$individual_id))` individual `r params$spp`s at the `r unique(dat$study_site)` colony were tagged and tracked with `r as.character(unique(dat$sensor_type))` tags.

These `r length(unique(dat$individual_id))` individuals generated `r nrow(dat)` detections between `r min(dat$timestamp)` UTC and `r max(dat$timestamp)` UTC.

Data are stored on Movebank in project number `r as.character(params$movebank_id)`.

```{r map, fig.cap = "Map of raw GPS locations."}
opp_map(dat)
```

# Trips

## Defining foraging trips

Foraging trips were identified as any continuous track at least `r params$minDist` km from the colony, which lasted for a minimum of `r params$minDur` hours. Trips were considered incomplete if the trips started or ended more than `r params$maxDist` km from the colony. Trips were considered 'gappy' if there were gaps between successive locations greater than `r params$gapTime` hours, and the bird traveled farther than `r params$gapDist` km during that time. 

The figures below show trips from each deployment, as defined by the criteria described above.

```{r get trips}
dat2 <- opp2KBA(dat)
trips <- opp_get_trips(dat2,
              innerBuff = params$minDist,
              returnBuff = params$maxDist,
              duration = params$minDur,
              gapTime = params$gapTime,
              gapDist = params$gapDist,
              gapLimit = params$gapLimit)
```

## Defined trips

```{r trip summary}
ft <- trips@data %>%
  filter(Type != 'Non-trip') %>%
  group_by(ID, tripID, Type) %>%
  mutate(
    duration = as.numeric(difftime(max(DateTime), min(DateTime), units = 'hours'))
  ) %>%
  group_by(Type) %>%
  summarize(
    `Number of trips` = length(unique(tripID)),
    `Number of locations` = n(),
    `Median duration (hrs)` = round(median(duration), 1),
    `Median trip distance (km)` = round(median(max(ColDist))/1000, 1)
    ) %>%
  flextable::flextable(cwidth =1.25)

print(ft)
```

# Track interpolation

Locations within complete, incomplete, and gappy trips were interpolated at a `r params$timestep` interval using a continuous time correlated random walk model. Figures below show the raw GPS locations (violet) overlain with the interpolated locations (green). Gaps in tracks during a trip, as defined above, were `r ifelse(params$interpolateGaps == F, 'not','')` interpolated.

```{r interpolation}
interp <- ctcrw_interpolation(trips,
                    site = dat2$site,
                    type = c('Complete', 'Incomplete', 'Gappy'),
                    timestep = params$timestep,
                    interpolateGaps = params$interpolateGaps)
```

## Interpolated trips summary

```{r interpolated summary}
my_trip_summary <- OPPtools::sum_trips(interp) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(duration = signif(duration, 3),
         max_dist_km = signif(max_dist_km, 3),
         departure = as.Date(departure)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(tripID, raw_n_locs, interp_n_locs, departure, duration, max_dist_km, complete) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(`Trip ID` = tripID,
         `GPS fixes` = raw_n_locs,
         `Interpolated locations` = interp_n_locs,
         `Start date` = departure,
         `Maximum distance (km)` = max_dist_km,
         `Duration (hrs)` = duration,
         Type = complete) %>% 
  flextable::flextable(cwidth =c(1.25, 1, 1, 1.5, 1, 1, 1)) 

n_tracks <- length(unique(my_interp$interp$ID))
