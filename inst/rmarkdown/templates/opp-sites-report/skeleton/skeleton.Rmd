# Data summary

GPS tracking was conducted on breeding `r params$spp`s at `r unique(dat$study_site)`. This colony has an estimated `r format(params$breeding_pairs, scientific = F, big.mark = ',')` breeding pairs, with the most recent colony count data from `r params$count_year` `r ifelse(params$movebank_id == 1904565280, '(Gaston and Dechesne 2020)', '(ECCC 2022)')`. `r track_years` Location data away from the colony were obtained from `r length(deps)` individuals (Figure 1 and Figure 2). `r stage_message` 
Raw tracking data are stored on Movebank (https://www.movebank.org/) in project number `r as.character(params$movebank_id)`. All analysis were conducted with `R` (version 4.1.0, R Core Team 2021). Code used to run analysis and generate this report is available at https://github.com/popovs/OPPtools.

# Individual utilization distributions

To focus on at-sea distribution, we first identified periods of time when birds were away from the colony. Tracked individuals were considered away from the colony if consecutive locations were more than  **`r params$minDist` km** from the colony for at least **`r params$minDur` hr**. GPS locations at-sea may be recorded at uneven intervals if birds are diving underwater or the logger could not obtain a fix for other reasons. In order to avoid bias in the utilization distributions due to missing locations, we interpolated at-sea data to a constant time interval of **`r params$timestep`** using a continuous-time correlated random walk model  with the `crawl` package (version 2.2.1, Johnson et al. 2008) in `R`. Prior to interpolation, we identified large gaps in tracks if there were no GPS fixes for at least **`r params$gapTime` hr** and the bird travelled more than **`r params$gapDist` km** during that time. Data were not interpolated across these larger gaps to avoid including interpolated locations with a high degree of uncertainty in kernel density estimates. For further details on how parameters for these analyses were selected, see the supporting methods document associated with this report.

A utilization distribution (UD) was calculated for each individual deployment using the *kernelUD* function in the `adehabitatHR` package (version 0.4.19, Calenge 2006) in `R`. All UDs were calculated on the the same  `r paste(params$gridRes, ' x ', params$gridRes, 'km')` grid, with a smoothing parameter value of `r round(smooth, 0.1)` km. `r if(params$kernelSmoother == "href"){"The smoothing parameter was determined using the href method, which is calculated from the variance in the X and Y dimensions of the location data (Beal et al 2021). This value was calculated for individual tracks and the median value across all tracks was used."} else if(params$kernelSmoother == "href/2"){"The smoothing parameter was based on the href method, which is calculated from the variance in the X and Y directions in the data (Beal et al 2021). Initial data exploration showed the href smoother over-simplified resulting utilization distributions, so the median href * 0.5 was used to obtain a more precise estimate of individual distributions."} else if(params$kernelSmoother == "step"){"The smoothing function was based on the median step length between consecutive locations across all individual interpolated tracks."}``r if(params$kernelSmoother == "step" & smooth == 1){"The step function resulted in a step smoother value of less than 1 km; therefore, UDs were calculated with a smoother value of 1 km."}` See the supporting methods document for a comparison of different smoothing parameters.

```

We evaluated the representativeness of the available tracking data using the `repAssess` function in the `track2KBA` package (Beal et al. 2021). Subsamples of tracks were drawn from the GPS tracks, and each subsample was used to calculate a pooled `r params$levelUD`% UD weighted by the number of interpolated locations within each track. An inclusion rate was calculated as the proportion of out-of-sample tracking locations that overlapped with the pooled UD. This sampling procedure was repeated `r params$iterations` times, for sample sizes between `r min(ra_table$SampleSize)` and `r max(ra_table$SampleSize)` tracks (the maximum sample size is n-3, to ensure an adequate proportion of out-of-sample tracking locations are available for calculating representativeness). A non-linear regression was used to estimate the sample size where the inclusion rate reaches an asymptote. Representativeness was calculated as

$$R = \frac{y_n}{A}*100$$

where *`A`* is the target asymptote, *`y`* is the inclusion rate, and *`n`* is the sample size. The inclusion rate should be similar to the target asymptote for a representative sample.

The estimated representativeness was `r signif(rep_target, 3)`% (Figure 2). The inclusion rate reached an asymptote at `r signif(ra_result$est_asym, 2)` and the target asymptote was `r ra_result$tar_asym`. The non-linear regression results indicate that a minimum sample size of `r ra_result$Rep95` tracks would be required to achieve 95% representativeness.

The `track2KBA` package (Beal et al. 2021) was used to quantify spatial overlap in UDs and estimate both the proportion and the total number of birds from the source population that predictably use at sea areas around the colony. These estimates are based on the proportion of overlapping home range (95% UD) areas in each raster grid cell multiplied by the calculated representativeness of the sample (`r signif(ra_result$out, 2)`%) and the source population size (`r format(params$breeding_pairs * 2, scientific = F, big.mark = ',')` individuals). Results from this analysis were aggregated to show the regions where at least 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90% of the individuals from the source population are expected to occur (Figure 3).
